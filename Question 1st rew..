I have a question about the style of a good requirement. Is it acceptable to write "To enter information about the husband, 
the user must go to the 'Husband' tab"; (when requirements describe what the user needs to do, such as filling in some text?) 
Or should the requirement's grammatical style be: "The application must support the functionality of entering information about the wife";
(when the requirement describes the functionality and how it should work?)
If there are no restrictions regarding it, I am interested in knowing more.

I'm also interested in understanding how detailed requirements should be. 
For example, is the statement "The application must support all existing versions of operating systems such as Windows, Android, macOS, iOS, and Linux" 
sufficient, or do real projects require more detailed specifications for each system version?
I understand that there needs to be a balance, but I'm curious if there are any techniques to determine the appropriate level of detail.
