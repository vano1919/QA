1. When determining the priority of a requirement, how can we differentiate between high, medium, and low when it's not clear-cut or obvious?
2. In the context of creating verifications, how detailed should they be? Are there any guidelines or indicators to help identify when a 
      verification is becoming too detailed or overly complex?
3. When it is not immediately obvious whether we need to create equivalent classes for verifications in software testing, how can we determine?
